Sample photo link--->https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qsoi9eOGmsZ8CMxBF9IjuwB2z3thOM_L/view?usp=share_link

Install !pip install qrcode, !pip install pillow, !pip install fpdf2 if required.

While running the program:

First create new aadhar using 1.to create new aadhar option

Update aadhar using 2.to update aadhar option ,if needed.

To download aadhar,use option 3,Initially 'request aadhar pdf' by entering 'A',this generates 'aadhar.pdf' file without qrcode in it.Now download that file and upload it in google drive and copy the link.

Next again,use option 3,This time request 'request qrcode' by entering 'Q',this generates 'qr2.png file',which is the image of the QR code.

Refresh the mongodb database.

Finally use option 4,'to download aadhar with qrcode' in it.

Download aadharfinal.pdf.This will have every detail with qrcode in it
